Functionality:
--------------------
On recieving a ROS topic message, this Gazebo-ROS plugin adds/removes a light to the Gazebo world.

Support:
--------------------
This plugin is tested for ROS kinetic and Gazebo 7.8.1.

Build Process:
--------------------
Follow standard process to build a gazebo plugin i.e., inside the build directory
(a) cmake ../
(b) make

Set environment variable GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH to gazebo_light_plugin directory. Ideally, this should be done in the .bashrc file

Add roslaunch files
--------------------
From the directory roslaunch_files using sudo copy following files
 
(a) turtlebot.launch to /opt/ros/<distro>/share/turtlebot_gazebo/launch
(b) brass.world to /opt/ros/<distro>/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds

In the brass.world file, libcontrol_light.so is mentioned as a plugin. This implied that plugin is initialized and loaded when brass.world is opened in Gazebo. 
The xml code ( <plugin name="contro_light" filename="libcontrol_light.so"/>) could be linked to any model in a new .world file.     


Commands
--------------------
To launch Gazebo, give the command roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot.launch
To test the functionality publish toggle_light message using command rostopic pub /ground_plane_0/toggle_light std_msgs/Empty
